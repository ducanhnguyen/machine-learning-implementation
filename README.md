Implementation of basic algorithms in machine learning

K-nearest neighbour, binary perceptron

Full gradient descent, batch gradient descent, stochatic gradient descent

Backpropogation improvements: Momentum, RMSPROP, Adagrad, step decay, etc.

Avoid overfiting: L1/L2 regularization, dropout, batch normalization, etc.
